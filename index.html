                   First post <em>has</em> to be about Mimo, the program that taught me how to code and make this beautiful website, 
              yes I know I know; it's still a work in progress! But it was actually really easy and user friendly learning 
              the basics of coding. You can get it in the iOS App Store, and Google Play store. Let it be known it is 
              not a free app, but it is worth every dollar I promise you. 
              Get your nerd on, and try it out for yourself :)

      <h4>My Story</h4>
      <p>Hey guys! My names Alysha, I'm 24 from Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. I work along side my (very annoying) boyfriend Jesse as a
        Line Locators assistant / Line Locator in Training ;) It's an interesting job to say the least, it's a constant puzzle of trying to
        figure out utility lines underground.. But that's a story for a different day.
        I am using this blog as an outlet to share my journey as I start living a more positive life, with health and fitness as well 
        as just finding self love again. I feel everybody needs to have something to inspire them in life, and I have ran short of that but it's
        about darn time I make a change, so I thought why not get creative with this website and get my blogging on to inspire myself â™¥
    </p>
      <p> Feel free to follow along on my social media accounts too!</p>
